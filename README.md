        title: "OBJECTIVE"
        content: |
          The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive process of a facial recognition system using Python, showcasing the various stages involved from face detection to face recognition. This report aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the key packages and tools available in Python for facial recognition, the methods to improve accuracy, and the industry-standard practices employed. By detailing the implementation and evaluation of a facial recognition system, this report seeks to demonstrate the practical applications and potential improvements in this transformative technology across different industries.
      - number: "1.2"
        title: "DEFINITION"
        content: |
          Facial recognition is a sophisticated biometric technology that identifies or verifies individuals by analysing and comparing unique patterns based on their facial features. This technology utilizes advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect, align, encode, and match faces in images or video streams. The facial recognition process involves several critical steps: face detection to identify areas with faces, face alignment to standardize the orientation, face encoding to convert facial features into numerical codes, and face matching to compare these codes and determine identity.
          In the context of this report, facial recognition is implemented using Python's extensive ecosystem of libraries, including OpenCV, which offers versatile face detection algorithms, Dlib, known for its efficient face detection and shape prediction, and Face_recognition, which simplifies face recognition tasks. Facial recognition technology is widely applied in various fields, providing accurate and reliable identification solutions for security, surveillance, and human-computer interaction, thereby enhancing safety and user experience.

    title: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION"
    content: |
      This project focuses on developing a robust and accurate facial recognition system using Python, leveraging its comprehensive ecosystem of libraries and tools. Facial recognition has revolutionized numerous industries, including security, surveillance, and human computer interaction, by providing reliable and efficient identification solutions. The project aims to explore and implement the various stages involved in facial recognition, from face detection to face recognition, using well-known Python libraries such as OpenCV, Dlib, and Face_recognition.
      The project is divided into several key components, each addressing a specific aspect of the facial recognition process.

    frontend_features:
      - "Sign-Up Page: Employees register with name, employee ID, mobile number, and email."
      - "Photo Upload: Employees upload photos required for recognition."
      - "Email Verification: OTP is sent via SMTP; user verifies email."
      - "Face Matching: Webcam capture compared to stored images."
      - "Punch In/Out and Break In/Out: Mark attendance and breaks."
      - "Geo-Tagging: Validates employee location during attendance."

    frontend_stack:
      - "HTML/CSS"
      - "JavaScript"
      - "Flask (templating + routes)"

    database_design:
      engine: "MySQL"
      entities:
        - name: "employees"
          fields: ["id", "name", "employee_id", "mobile", "email", "photo_longblob", "created_at"]
        - name: "attendance_logs"
          fields: ["id", "employee_id", "type (punch_in|punch_out|break_in|break_out)", "timestamp", "geotag_lat", "geotag_lng"]
        - name: "otps"
          fields: ["id", "email", "otp_code", "expires_at", "consumed (bool)"]
      notes: |
        Photos are stored as LONG_BLOB. Indexes on employee_id and email improve lookup performance.

    backend_features:
      - "Image Capture & Processing with OpenCV."
      - "Face Matching using Face_recognition (Dlib) encodings."
      - "Similarity thresholds with Euclidean/Cosine metrics."
      - "SMTP integration for OTP email verification."
      - "Secure routes for attendance events and logs."

    recognition_pipeline:
      steps:
        - "Face Detection (Haar Cascades/Dlib HOG/CNN)."
        - "Face Alignment (landmarks-based)."
        - "Face Encoding (128-d embeddings)."
        - "Face Matching (Euclidean distance + threshold)."
      threshold_tuning: |
        The decision threshold balances false positives and false negatives. Multiple samples per user and lighting normalization improve robustness.

project_overview: |
  The Facial Recognition Attendance System (FRAS) is an AI-powered attendance solution built with Python, Flask, MySQL, OpenCV, Dlib, and Face_recognition. It automates employee attendance with OTP-verified signup, webcam-based recognition, geotag validation, and reliable punch/break logging.
